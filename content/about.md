## Project Experience

### OneDrop: Bag of Emergency Food Project (WeChat Mini Program)

**Duration**: July 2021 – December 2021  
I developed the frontend of a WeChat mini-program for selling near-expiry food items as part of a campus-based e-commerce startup. I implemented the interface based on UI designs. The mini-program was successfully launched and won the "Challenge Cup" organized by the Telecommunications Institute.

---

### Smart Campus - WeLink Mini Program (WeCode)

**Duration**: August 2021 – October 2021  
As the project leader and founder, I led the development of a frontend demo for a WeLink-based smart campus mini-program (although it was not ultimately launched).  
- **Background**: With over 700,000 organizations using WeLink, we saw a gap in tailored applications for university students.  
- **Tech Stack**: Frontend was implemented with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and WeLink API; backend was planned with SpringBoot and MySQL.  
- **My Role**: I coordinated team efforts, prepared business plans, presentation materials, and videos, and participated in frontend development. Our project won a **Provincial Bronze Prize** in the “Internet+” Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition.

### Major Project: Database Systems

**Duration**: November 2022 – December 2022  
**Environment**: Windows 11 + Python 3 + Flask + MySQL  
I designed a relational database system for a car-sharing service described in a provided case study. I also developed a frontend webpage to support user interactions with the backend.

---

### Major Project: System Programming

**Duration**: December 2022 – January 2023  
**Environment**: Huawei Linux Server  
I implemented a terminal-based multi-user chat system using the C language. It featured real-time communication via public named pipes (FIFOs), message monitoring with select, and multithreaded server-side processing using a thread pool. The system also supported event logging and permission control.

# Research field

| Interest | Description | 
| -------- | ---------- |
| AIoT | **AIoT** is the convergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), allowing smart devices to not only communicate but also analyze data, learn from it, and make autonomous decisions. This integration enables IoT devices to go beyond simple data collection and transmission, allowing knowledge to be applied in real-world situations. **Research areas of AIoT** include but are not limited to smart cities, industrial automation, healthcare, and connected vehicles. **I am particularly interested in** the potential of AIoT to revolutionize industries by creating adaptive, intelligent systems that interact seamlessly with their surroundings. **To me**, AIoT represents a way to make academic knowledge practical and tangible, **integrating advanced technology into daily life**. AIoT marks the next step in the evolution of smart systems, with the ability to transform everything from infrastructure to personal devices. I am eager to contribute to the development and application of AIoT technologies, leveraging its potential to create smarter, more efficient, and responsive environments. |
| Embodied Intelligence | **Embodied intelligence is a form of artificial intelligence that interacts directly with the environment through physical agents, simulating the perception and motor abilities of humans or animals.** This form of intelligence emphasizes the interaction between perception and action, learning and adapting through real-time interaction with the physical world, in contrast to traditional, non-embodied intelligence that relies solely on pre-collected datasets for learning. Research areas of embodied intelligence include but are not limited to robotics, natural language processing, computer vision, machine learning, cognitive science, and human-computer interaction, aiming to create intelligent agents capable of understanding and influencing their surrounding world. **I am interested in embodied intelligence, which stems from my admiration for the Iron Man series of movies, and I really hope that robots similar to "Jarvis" will emerge in various industries in the future. To me, embodied intelligence represents a frontier and revolutionary direction in the field of artificial intelligence, challenging and expanding the boundaries of traditional AI.** Embodied intelligence, by enabling machines to perceive, learn, and act in the physical world, mimicking the way humans or animals interact with the environment, opens up new possibilities for research and applications. It involves not only technological and engineering breakthroughs but also a deep understanding and application of principles from cognitive science, psychology, and biology, providing new perspectives and tools for creating more natural and effective human-computer interaction. **I hope to have the opportunity to work in related fields such as robotics and human-computer interaction in the future, and I am very eager to contribute to this revolutionary field of embodied intelligence.** |
